The foods you eat when you are expecting are the main source of nutrients for the baby growing inside you. Therefore, it is essential to know what to eat or what to avoid. Here are a few food items that you can eat: prioritize fresh fruits and vegetables over any food product. Include lots of raw salads and probiotics to your diet. Try the Mediterranean diet that includes virgin olive oil, pulses, fresh fruit, fish, and small quantities of healthy fats. This helps in fighting hypertension during pregnancy, which is a major cause of miscarriage.
