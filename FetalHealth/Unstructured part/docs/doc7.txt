Ideally, you're at a ehalthy weight before you even get pregnant. A major concerning trend that I'm seeing is that many women are overweight going into the pregnancy,caffeine which puts them at a higher risk for gestational diabetes. Dietary discussions before achieving a pregnancy are extremely important, but often don't take place.
