## Description

The goal of this project was to analyze the dataset from this source:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nantonio/a-hotels-customers-dataset


This customer dataset describes 83,590 customers of a hotel in Lisbon, Portugal.

The data include three full years of personal, behavioral, demographic, and geographic customer information (39 variables).


Because of its unity of analysis, it is a particularly suitable data collection for building customer segmentation models, including clustering models, but it can also be used in association analysis problems, after possibly discretizing some numerical attributes.
