There are a lot of myths and old wives tales about what to eat and what to avoid during pregnancy, but this is a question you should broach with your ob-gyn. Uncooked beef such as steak tartare and carpaccio can contain the organism toxoplasmosis, which can cause birth defects. Soft cheeses that are unpasteurized can carry an organism called Listeria, which, if a mother gets infected with it during pregnancy, can cause a serious illness that could cause still birth.
