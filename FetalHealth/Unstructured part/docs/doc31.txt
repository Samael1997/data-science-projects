At-home pregnancy tests work by detecting the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in your urine. That hormone is only released when you're pregnant. In very uncommon cases, a miscarriage, some cancers, or certain medications may create a false positive result, but most of the time, a positive result means you're pregnant. False negatives are far more common because many women test too early.
