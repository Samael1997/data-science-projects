Yes, in moderation, that is. Caffeine is a stimulant that can cross the placenta and affect your baby’s heart rate and breathing. The general recommendation is no more than two cups of coffee per day but remember that there is caffeine in other products such as iced tea and soft drinks. If you don’t want to kick the habit, go decaf or limit your intake.
