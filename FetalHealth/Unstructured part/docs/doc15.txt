Your medications may need to be stopped, adjusted, or switched. Very few drugs have been approved as absolutely safe during pregnancy. However, many medications have good safety records and do not increase risk for birth defects or adverse pregnancy outcomes when taken as directed. Some medications should be avoided in the first trimester, but may be okay to take later during pregnancy. It is important to weigh the severity of your symptoms against the possible risks to your baby.
