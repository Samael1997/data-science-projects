To reduce the risk of foodborne illness, consume only meat, fish, eggs, and poultry that are fully cooked. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products. Avoid soft cheeses (Brie, feta, Camembert) unless the label clearly states it's made from pasteurized milk. Thoroughly rinse fresh fruits and raw vegetables under running water (about 30 seconds) before eating. Avoid eating raw sprouts. Do not eat refrigerated smoked seafood, unless cooked in a casserole. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten.
