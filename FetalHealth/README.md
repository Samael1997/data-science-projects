# Fetal Health Project

## Description
The goal of this project was to develop a system for tracking maternal fetal health of pregnant mothers.
The folder is divided into three parts:
- the Schemas folder where the schemas er and of the designed system are collected;
- the structured data part, where the databases designed along with the data analysis are presented;
- the unstructured data part, where textual analysis was done via an NLP pipeline with structuring;
There are then two pdf files with documentation for each part and for further discussion.
