Knowing whether you’ll have a vaginal or C-section delivery with your first baby is very hard to predict. Often times you and your doctor won’t know until you go into labor. The U.S. C-section rate is about 30 percent, but it’s also good to ask your doctor what his or her individual rate is. Ultimately, you will have to trust your physician to make the best decision for you and your baby.
