As you've discovered, your belly isn't the only thing expanding during your pregnancy. A pregnant body produces the hormone relaxin, which causes your pelvic ligaments and joints to loosen to make room for the baby's exit. That same hormone also relaxes the ligaments in your feet, allowing the bones to separate a bit. This, coupled with the fact that your increased weight puts more pressure on your foot arches, causing them to fall a bit, makes your feet grow. On average, you'll go up half a shoe size. Plus, our feet tend to swell from retained fluids. Any change in size from fluid retention will disappear about a month post-delivery, but your new shoe size is here to stay.
