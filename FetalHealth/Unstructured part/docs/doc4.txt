Occasional mild-to-moderate stress probably does not affect the pregnancy, but big issues affect every part of your life. Have a candid conversation with your ob-gyn and tell her about some of the big stressors in your life (problems with your spouse, a big move, or job issues). She may be able to recommend a good therapist or a support group.
