The baby's sex is determined with an ultrasound between 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. This isn't the primary reason ultrasounds are done, though. They're used to evaluate a baby's growth, check for birth defects, and more. Sex can also be revealed via tests used to screen for genetic disorders. There's also a more invasive genetic screening test called amniocentesis, in which doctors collect a sample of fluid from the placenta that contains the baby's DNA.  These are more reliable than ultrasound when it comes to determining sex, but just as with ultrasound, these tests aren't used solely for that purpose.
