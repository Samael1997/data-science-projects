No! Pregnancy is not the time to diet.Hypoglycemic Starve yourself and you starve your baby. You could miss out on giving your baby all the nutrients he/she needs to develop properly. Don’t be afraid of weight gain – it is completely normal; but also don’t see this as a time to eat whatever you want . An increase of approximately 9 to 12kg or even a little more is normal. It all depends on your body, build and height and the weight you were when you became pregnant.
