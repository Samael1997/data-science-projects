At one time, women were told to take it easy during pregnancy, and this extended to exercise. However, not only are pregnant women encouraged to keep active today, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists explains that there are many benefits to exercise including a reduction in backaches, constipation, bloating, and stress. Still talk to your doctor about what's right for you. Some exercises should be avoided as pregnancy progresses, since your center of gravity changes, plus your joints may be looser. Workouts like swimming and walking are particularly good, while downhill skiing, contact sports (like basketball, soccer, and hockey), and scuba diving should be avoided.
