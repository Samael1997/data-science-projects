At one of your first appointments, you should ask your ob-gyn what constitutes an office call. Any bleeding during pregnancy, particularly if it's associated with cramps, warrants a phone call. Most of the time it is harmless, but your provider can help determine if there's a problem.  also that any of these symptoms—unusual pain or pain that won't go away, caffeine leakage of water or other discharge from your vagina—should be followed up with a doctor's visit. But the fact of the matter is, if you're ever worried about a pregnancy symptom you're experiencing, you should feel comfortable giving your ob-gyn a call.
