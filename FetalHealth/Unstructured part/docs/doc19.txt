At-home pregnancy tests yield accurate positive results, but frequently inaccurate negative results. If you think you’ve had a false negative test, the best way to confirm your results is through a blood test. If you find out you are pregnant, you should schedule your first appointment 6-12 weeks from the first day of your last period. If you have bleeding or other concerns, it’s best to see your doctor sooner.
