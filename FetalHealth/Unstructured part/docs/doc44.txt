You may feel like defining the stages of labor as panic, the long haul, and finishedâ€”but they are a little better defined in medical terms. Labor means the regular, repetitive contraction of the uterus leading to the successive effacement and dilation of the cervix. The first stage occurs from the onset of these regular contractions to four to five centimeters of dilation. This stage may take many hours and averages about nine hours in a first labor. The second stage occurs from four to five centimeters to complete dilation and is accompanied by the descent of the presenting part to about halfway or more down the birth canal. Usually, dilation occurs more rapidly in this stage than the first. The cervix usually opens at least one to two centimeters per hour during this stage, so that whole second stage is two and a half to five hours. The third stage of labor is the expulsion of the placenta, or afterbirth, which can take five minutes to a half-hour after delivery.
