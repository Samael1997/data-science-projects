Women are born with a fixed amount of eggs in their ovaries and, as they get older, they're left with fewer eggs that are more likely to have genetic abnormalities. This is why a woman's fertility decreases with age. This decline starts around age 30 and speeds up in the mid-30s. When women get pregnant in their late 30s or 40s, there's a higher risk for certain complications, including birth defects, miscarriage, stillbirth, multiple pregnancy.
